Goal 1: Every two weeks I'll help advise people enough to get "Thank You"s as a response

Rubric:
- 4:I get many "Thank You"'s as a response to my helpful behavior
- 3:People thank me for efforts to help, but does not happen once or more every two weeks
- 2:I get few expressions of grattitude, but not many
- 1:People give me negative responses to my help because I cause their projects to go awry
